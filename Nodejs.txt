Ryan Dahl - Creator of Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
Node.js is a JavaScript running on the server.


Chrome's V8 engine: Converts Js code into machine code.
1. Built for Google Chrome
2. Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler:A just-in-time compiler is a feature of the V8 engine that translates
JavaScript code into machine code at runtime. Unlike an interpreter, 
which reads and executes code line by line, a JIT compiler converts 
the entire script into machine code before execution. 
This process improves performance as the compiled machine
code can be executed faster than interpreting each line individually.

History Of Nodejs:
In 2009 an idea came in the mind of Ryan Dahl(Google Engineer)
that why not run JS outside browser, so he took V8 engine and embedded in 
a C++ program and called it Node.exe and later on became 
Nodejs.

When to Use Node.js:

Ideal for I/O bound tasks and data streaming applications.
Well-suited for real-time chat applications due to its non-blocking, asynchronous nature.
 

Modules: Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries. A set of functions you want to include in your appliaction.
Node.js has a set of built-in modules which we can use without any further installation.
